# themoviedb-api-tv-movie-web-app
I developed this application in sophomore year of Engineering.

This comprises a MEAN stack application architecture.

This uses 'themoviedb' free API to search for TV shows, Movies and display relevant information regarding them.
It also has tabs for Recent Movies/Shows.

Also has a option for user signup/login.

I wrote this around 3 years back, so I apologise for the code quality.
