# themoviedb-api-tv-movie-web-app
I developed this application in sophomore year of Engineering.

It comprises a MEAN stack application architecture.

It Uses 'themoviedb' free API to search for TV shows, Movies and display relevant information regarding them. It also has tabs for Recent Movies/Shows.

Also has an option for user signup/login.

I wrote this around three years back, so I apologize for the code quality.
